ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* hs_err_pid2144.log
* hs_err_pid3820.log
* hs_err_pid4616.log
* hs_err_pid5752.log
* ic_launcher-web.png
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets
* libs\activeandroid-3.1-beta.jar => app\libs\activeandroid-3.1-beta.jar
* libs\android-support-v4.jar => app\libs\android-support-v4.jar
* libs\greendao-1.3.7.jar => app\libs\greendao-1.3.7.jar
* libs\greendao-generator-1.3.0.jar => app\libs\greendao-generator-1.3.0.jar
* libs\ormlite-android-4.48.jar => app\libs\ormlite-android-4.48.jar
* libs\ormlite-core-4.48.jar => app\libs\ormlite-core-4.48.jar
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\
* src-gen\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
